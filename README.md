Get the Game Running
The Game May be Incomplete But every part of the code works. This means you can simply hit play on the code in the main and the game will work :)
If there is an issue run through IntelliJ from the second folder

Guidelines for using Blue Boy Adventure's code and assets

I often receive inquiries about showing or publishing games created using the code and assets (images/sound/editor) used in my Blue Boy Adventure tutorials, so I thought I should clarify the guidelines.

For releasing to a closed network (such as for a school project or showing it to your friends):
Basically, there are no restrictions. You are free to use my code and assets as you like. Crediting me is not required, but I would appreciate it if you do.
