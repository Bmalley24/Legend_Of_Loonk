# Legend_Of_Loonk

Get the Game Running
The Game May be Incomplete But every part of the code works. This means you can simply hit play on the code in the main and the game will work :)
If there is an issue run through IntelliJ from the second folder

Guidelines for using Blue Boy Adventure's code and assets

I often receive inquiries about showing or publishing games created using the code and assets (images/sound/editor) used in my Blue Boy Adventure tutorials, so I thought I should clarify the guidelines.

For releasing to a closed network (such as for a school project or showing it to your friends):
Basically, there are no restrictions. You are free to use my code and assets as you like. Crediting me is not required, but I would appreciate it if you do.

Files
Of all the files I added to my project they can be separated into 5 main categories
1. Maps
This is the Easiest and simplest file. A text file my code reads to know where it should print each tile to create a map.

2. PLayer Assets
These files include every frame of animation my code needs to display to create an animation.

3. Object Assets
These files include what every Object in my game looks like.

4. Tile Assets
These files are all used for the background. They are every image I might need to create a seamless background the the game plays over. All 16x16 sprites

5. Sounds
These audio files are every song and Sound effect I either use or plan to use in future versions of the game.
